        <p>My most active repo is the https://github.com/BusKill/usb-a-magnetic-breakaway. For the past four years, I have been building a 3D printed case for a USB-A magnetic decoupler that could be used with the Open Hardware BusKill cable.  </p>
<p>The https://github.com/goldfishlaser/doesitpenplot repo contains pen plot files for when I worked on a pen plot documentation project for Open Source Ecology. https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/User:Goldfishlaser</p>
<p>I keep not paying the extremely cheap web hosting bill for my web site, but if I ever wanted to relaunch the thing I could from this repo: https://github.com/goldfishlaser/website. </p>
    <p>The https://github.com/goldfishlaser/printmodels repo has some STLS for 3D printed knickknacks I've created. I also post things on thingiverse. </p>

<p><i>"Jokes?" he asked. 

"Let's hear one." 

"Why is a laser beam like a goldfish?" 

Mike knew about lasers but where would he have seen goldfish? Oh, 
he had undoubtedly seen flicks of them and, were I foolish enough to ask, 
could spew forth thousands of words. "I give up." 

His lights rippled. "Because neither one can whistle." </i> </p>
